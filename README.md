# Problem Statement: Find if a given 2D point is inside or outside a circle

Given Input: Center of circle (X1, Y1) with Radius R, and other point as (X2, Y2) for which we need to tell that it exists in circle or on the circle or outside the circle.

Formula used: Distance formula,

Distance between two points = square_root(([X2-X1]^2)+((Y2-Y1)^2))
